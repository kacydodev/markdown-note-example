Example of how I organize notes whilst working through Scrimba's Express.js course.

Advantages:
- Simple to use. Can be customized as much or as little as you want
- One source of truth. All discoveries, questions, ponderings related to this project in one place
- Easily accessed on the go, even on mobile (just remember to push updated note)
- Code example can be contextualised for quick reference
- Power tools like [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) can assist with visualizing

Disclaimer: This is just ONE way of taking note.
